# The default container is used by all tools that do not specify any <requirements> in their tool wrappers.
# This usually applies to old and simple tools that do not need any other packages besides those that are used by Galaxy itself.
# Since these tools expect those packages to be available on the server anyway, they have not bothered to specify them as requirements.
# Previous iterations of the default container used PIP to install all the packages that are listed as required dependencies of Galaxy:
#   - https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/lib/galaxy/dependencies/pinned-requirements.txt
#   - https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/lib/galaxy/dependencies/conditional-requirements.txt
#
# However, this version of the container does not install anything except for Python 3.8.19 and a few common utilities that are expected on most systems.
# Instead, it activates Galaxy's virtual environment to get access to all these packages. (The venv-directory should be mounted by Singularity).
# The installed Python 3.8.19 is the same as the one that was installed on all the nodes and is referenced by symlinks in the virtual environment.
# Some internal Galaxy tools (like "export history") run code from the Galaxy codebase itself, and for this reason,
# the directory containing Galaxy's codebase (/srv/galaxy/server/lib) is added to the PYTHONPATH on startup.
