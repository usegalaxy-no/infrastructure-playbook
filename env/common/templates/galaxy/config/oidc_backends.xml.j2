This file shall be properly set for user authentication and authorization leveraging the OpenID Connect protocol.
Here we provide a quick reference for configuration setters, and we provide a complete documentation
at the following page:

Quick Reference
_______________

- provider:         Sets the name of OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP).
                    The following IdPs are currently supported:

                        { "Google", "Globus" }

- client id:        Sets the id of this client (i.e., your Galaxy instance) with the IdP, which is
                    obtained from the IdP at client registration.
                    See: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.2

- client secret:    A secret generated by IdP for your client upon its registration.
                    See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1



IMPORTANT NOTES
_______________

While registering your client (i.e., your Galaxy instance), you would need to provide the IdP with a
`redirect_uri`: a URL at which the IdP will callback your Galaxy instance upon a successful user authentication.

This URL for your Galaxy instance is composed as:

    <host_url>/authnz/<provider>/callback


Some examples:

- using localhost to authenticate with Google:
    http://localhost:8080/authnz/google/callback

- using localhost to authenticat with Globus:
    http://localhost:8080/authnz/globus/callback

- using an instance hosted at `https://usegalaxy.org` with Google:
    https://usegalaxy.org/authnz/google/callback


Please mind `http` and `https`.
